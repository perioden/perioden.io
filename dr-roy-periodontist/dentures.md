<h5>Fixed Implant Supported Dentures</h5>

<p>Conventional dentures have a tendency to come loose because of the ineffectiveness of dental adhesives—but with implant supported dentures, that ceases to be a problem.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of stabilising dentures with dental implants are:

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Improved speech and confidence</li>
<li>It’s a minimally invasive procedure</li>
<li>Ends the cost and inconvenience of denture adhesives</li>
<li>Restores proper chewing. This allows for a better diet and improved health</li>
<li>Helps stimulate your jaw and maintain bone structure</li>
</ul></p>


<h5>What to expect</h5>
<p>During your initial consultation an x-ray will be taken and a mould of your teeth created to observe the implant position. If you do not have adequate jaw bone structure you may require a bone graft prior to surgery.</p>

<p>After this we will then advise the best form of treatment (either fixed, removable or implant-stabilised) and the best way to proceed with this treatment.</p>

<h4>Different types of implant supported overdentures</h4>

<p>There are three different treatment options with implant supported dentures:</p>

<h5>Fixed</h5>
<p>If  all of your teeth require replacement, a custom made denture can be fitted to dental implant foundations. Once the implants are inserted and have healed, you will be fitted for an overdenture that attaches to the implants. Due to the fact that the overdenture is supported by dental implants it can help stimulate the jaw and  maintain bone mass.
</p><p>Fixed dentures can be removed by a dentist for  professional cleaning and maintenance.
</p>
<h5>Removable</h5>
<p>A removable implant-supported overdenture is created in a similar fashion to a fixed implant-supported overdenture. However,  once the dental implants are placed in your jaw, a custom-made bar will be attached to the implants to support the new overdenture.
</p><p>Your new overdenture will be able to snap or clip into place, and you will be able to remove it for cleaning yourself.
</p>
<h5>Implant-stabilised</h5>
<p>Implant-stabilised overdentures are custom created in the same manner as fixed and removable dentures. However, a smaller number of implants are used to stabilise the denture. This type of denture is able to be taken out each night to clean it.

<h4>Removable Implant Supported Denture</h4>
<p></p>

<p>The biggest challenge with the conventional denture is that it is supported on gum tissue. Therefore, its chewing efficiency is only 20 to 30 percent as compared to natural teeth. As the time goes by our gums and the bone shrinks and the denture become loose and at times can be a cause of embarrassment in public. As the conventional denture is retained by our muscles, cheeks and gums they need a broad base and that is why these dentures covers the roof of the mouth with a plate, for extra support and retention.
</p>
<p>The removable implant supported denture overcomes all the above drawbacks. They gain very good retention and support from the implants underneath. Furthermore, the implants do not allow the gum and the bone to shrink rapidly. The upper denture need not extend on the roof of the mouth with a broad plate and therefore one feels more natural while eating and talking. They also need less number of implants as compared to fix implant supported teeth and therefore costs less.</p>

<p>The removable implant supported dentures gives good esthetics as they support lips, cheeks and shows right amount of gum and teeth. Some of the patients may have lost so much of bone over the time that the implant supported fix bridge will not be able to replace the lost bone and gum and may look unnatural. The removable implant supported dentures, however, can overcome these draw backs.</p>

<p>The removable implant supported dentures are basically anchored to Implants in two ways-
</p>
<p>1. With the clip on type of attachments called locators.
</p>
<p>2. Bar is seated on the implants and the denture gets anchorage from the bar.
</p>
<p>Both the types of the dentures gives high level of satisfaction for chewing and aesthetics to the patient.

<h5>Conventional Dentures</h5> 
<p>Conventional dentures are one of the most widely used solutions for patients who have lost all or most of their teeth. They are a removable prosthetic device that replaces missing teeth and restores a patient’s ability to chew, speak, and smile. Unlike implant-supported dentures, conventional dentures rely solely on the gums and the underlying bone structure for support.</p> 

<h5>Benefits of Conventional Dentures</h5> 

<p>While newer technologies like dental implants have introduced advanced alternatives, conventional dentures still offer several benefits for certain patients:</p> 
<ul class="bullets"> 
<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Conventional dentures are typically less expensive than implant-supported dentures, making them an accessible option for many patients.</li> 
<li><strong>Non-surgical option:</strong> Unlike dental implants, which require surgery to place, conventional dentures can be fitted without any surgical procedures. This makes them an ideal choice for patients who are not candidates for surgery due to health reasons.</li> 
<li><strong>Improved appearance:</strong> Modern dentures are designed to look natural, providing a significant aesthetic improvement for patients who are missing teeth.</li> 
<li><strong>Quick solution:</strong> Dentures can be fabricated relatively quickly compared to the longer process of placing implants, offering a timely option for tooth replacement.</li> </ul> 

<h5>Challenges of Conventional Dentures</h5> 

<p>Despite their benefits, conventional dentures come with certain limitations that may affect long-term comfort and functionality:</p> 
<ul class="bullets"> 
<li><strong>Bone loss over time:</strong> Since conventional dentures rest on the gums, they do not stimulate the jawbone the way implants do. Over time, this lack of stimulation can lead to bone resorption (bone loss), which may cause dentures to become loose or ill-fitting.</li> 
<li><strong>Reduced chewing efficiency:</strong> Conventional dentures offer only 20–30% of the chewing power of natural teeth, making it difficult to eat certain foods. This reduced functionality can affect a patient’s diet and nutrition.</li> 
<li><strong>Adhesives and stability:</strong> Many patients need to use denture adhesives to keep their dentures in place, as dentures can sometimes shift or slip while speaking or eating, which may be uncomfortable or embarrassing.</li> 
<li><strong>Gum irritation:</strong> Since conventional dentures rest directly on the gums, they can cause irritation, especially if they become loose or do not fit properly.</li> </ul> 

<h5>What to Expect with Conventional Dentures</h5> 

<p>The process of getting conventional dentures typically involves several steps:</p> <ul class="bullets"> <li><strong>Initial consultation:</strong> During your first visit, Dr. Roy will examine your mouth, take impressions of your gums, and discuss your treatment goals. If you still have some remaining teeth, they may need to be extracted before you can be fitted for dentures.</li> 
<li><strong>Fabrication of dentures:</strong> Once impressions are taken, custom dentures will be fabricated to match the contours of your gums and the shape of your mouth. The process may take a few weeks as the dentures are carefully crafted to ensure a precise fit.</li> 
<li><strong>Fitting and adjustments:</strong> Once your dentures are ready, Dr. Roy will ensure they fit properly and make any necessary adjustments for comfort. It’s normal to experience some discomfort or difficulty speaking and eating at first, but this should improve as you adjust to wearing the dentures.</li> 
<li><strong>Follow-up appointments:</strong> Over time, you may need to have your dentures relined or adjusted as the shape of your gums and jawbone changes. Regular follow-up appointments will help maintain a comfortable and functional fit.</li> </ul> 
<h5>Is Conventional Denture the Right Option for You?</h5> 
<p>For patients who are not candidates for dental implants or prefer a non-surgical solution, conventional dentures can still be an effective way to restore function and aesthetics. However, it’s important to be aware of the potential limitations, including the need for periodic adjustments and the possibility of gum irritation.</p> 
<p>If you are unsure whether conventional dentures are the right choice, Dr. Roy can discuss your options and help you decide on the best solution for your specific needs. During your consultation, Dr. Roy will consider your dental health, bone structure, lifestyle, and budget to recommend the most suitable option, whether that’s conventional dentures, implant-supported dentures, or another treatment.</p>
