<p>Every one would like to keep their natural teeth for lifelong. However, if you are suffering from silent gum disease, you may loose your teeth earlier. Dr. Roy can help in diagnosing the gum disease and treat the root cause of the disease. Using this approach will effectively treat the gum disease. You will benefit by having healthy teeth and gums, which can significantly extend the life of the teeth.</p>

<p>If you happen to be in a stage of advanced periodontal disease and your teeth cannot be saved or you have already lost your teeth, Dr. Roy can provide Dental Implant supported fixed or removable teeth. You can expect the final result to look natural, pleasing and long lasting. Dr. Roy looks at all the aspects of the smile and gum tissue and based on that he will make a customized treatment plan. In most of the situations you can get fixed teeth immediately after removing the teeth.</p>

<p>A dental implant is a conservative way to replace a missing tooth. If you are missing one or more teeth, but do not like to wear full or partial denture and would prefer to leave the adjacent teeth untouched, dental implants are an excellent choice.</p>

<p>The cost of dental implants maybe more affordable than what you think. Our office will present all options. The best dental implant solution for one patient, may not be the best for another.</p>

<p>At Dr. Roy's Perio Dental office in Abbotsford, we try to understand what is the exact concern for each patient and come up with the best solution to meet the patientâ€™s needs.</p>
