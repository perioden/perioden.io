<h4>Why Periodontal Health Matters</h4>
<p>Periodontal health is crucial for overall well-being. Healthy gums provide a strong foundation for your teeth and play a vital role in maintaining oral hygiene. Gum disease, if left untreated, can lead to tooth loss, bone damage, and has been linked to systemic health issues such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. By prioritizing your periodontal health, you can prevent these complications and enjoy a healthier, more confident smile.</p>
