<p>When considering dental implants, cost is often one of the first questions patients have. Dental implants are an investment, not just in terms of your oral health, but in restoring your ability to eat, smile, and speak with confidence. At Perio Dental, Dr. Roy ensures that each patient receives the best possible care and long-term value, using top-quality materials and advanced techniques.</p>

<h5>What Contributes to the Cost of Dental Implants?</h5>

<p>It’s important to understand that dental implant pricing varies depending on several factors, including the number of implants required, the condition of your bone, and whether additional procedures like bone grafting are necessary. While some dental offices may offer lower quotes, these often come with hidden compromises in the materials used, the expertise of the provider, or the quality of post-operative care.</p>

<h5>The Value of Expertise: Specialist vs. General Dentist</h5>

<p>When you choose Dr. Roy, a certified specialist in periodontics, you’re not just paying for the implant. You’re also paying for his extensive education and training, which includes years of postgraduate study in dental implants, gum health, and bone grafting. A general dentist may offer implants at a lower cost, but they often lack the advanced training and specialized techniques that Dr. Roy offers. With a periodontist, you’re investing in precision and long-term success, ensuring your implant lasts for decades, not just a few years.</p>

<h5>Why We Use Straumann Implants: Quality That Lasts</h5>

<p>At Perio Dental, we exclusively use <b>Straumann implants</b>, one of the most well-researched and trusted implant brands worldwide. Straumann implants have a 98.8% long-term survival rate, making them a durable and reliable choice for patients seeking quality. Think of it this way: using cheaper implant brands is like opting for a low-quality store-brand paper towel when you really need a high-end brand like Bounty. The cheaper option may work initially, but it won’t last as long or be as effective in the long run. At Perio Dental, we believe in giving our patients the best, which is why we don’t compromise on implant quality.</p>

<h5>Our Focus on Sterilization and Precision</h5>

<p>Another crucial factor in the success of dental implants is the care taken during the procedure. Our clinic follows strict sterilization protocols to reduce any risk of infection, which is one of the leading causes of implant failure. During major surgeries, even our countertops are covered with sterilized paper to maintain a pristine environment. These meticulous measures may seem small, but they go a long way in ensuring the longevity of your dental implants.</p>

<h5>Dental Implants: A Lifetime Investment</h5>

<p>Dental implants, when placed by an experienced specialist like Dr. Roy, are designed to last a lifetime. While other tooth replacement options like dentures or bridges may appear cheaper upfront, they often need repair or replacement every few years, adding to the total cost over time. In contrast, dental implants offer a long-lasting solution, and when properly cared for, can remain functional for decades.</p>

<h5>Why You Shouldn’t Be Fooled by Low-Cost Offers</h5>

<p>Low-cost implant options often cut corners in ways that aren’t immediately visible. Whether it's through using lower-quality materials, shortcuts in sterilization, or a lack of follow-up care, these offers may save you money initially but could lead to costly problems down the road. With Dr. Roy, you’re assured of receiving treatment that prioritizes your health, safety, and long-term success over a cheap price tag.</p>
