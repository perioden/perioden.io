<h5>Understanding the Cost of Dental Implants: Why Choose Us for Your Treatment</h5>

<p>When considering dental implants, cost is often one of the first questions patients have. Dental implants are an investment, not just in terms of your oral health, but in restoring your ability to eat, smile, and speak with confidence. At Perio Dental, Dr. Roy ensures that each patient receives the best possible care and long-term value, using top-quality materials and advanced techniques.</p>

<h5>What Contributes to the Cost of Dental Implants?</h5>

<p>It’s important to understand that dental implant pricing varies depending on several factors, including the number of implants required, the condition of your bone, and whether additional procedures like bone grafting are necessary. While some dental offices may offer lower quotes, these often come with hidden compromises in the materials used, the expertise of the provider, or the quality of post-operative care.</p>

<h5>The Value of Expertise: Specialist vs. General Dentist</h5>

<p>When you choose Dr. Roy, a certified specialist in periodontics, you’re not just paying for the implant. You’re also paying for his extensive education and training, which includes years of postgraduate study in dental implants, gum health, and bone grafting. A general dentist may offer implants at a lower cost, but they often lack the advanced training and specialized techniques that Dr. Roy offers. With a periodontist, you’re investing in precision and long-term success, ensuring your implant lasts for decades, not just a few years.</p>

<h5>Why We Use Straumann Implants: Quality That Lasts</h5>

<p>At Perio Dental, we exclusively use <b>Straumann implants</b>, one of the most well-researched and trusted implant brands worldwide. Straumann implants have a 98.8% long-term survival rate, making them a durable and reliable choice for patients seeking quality. Think of it this way: using cheaper implant brands is like opting for a low-quality store-brand paper towel when you really need a high-end brand like Bounty. The cheaper option may work initially, but it won’t last as long or be as effective in the long run. At Perio Dental, we believe in giving our patients the best, which is why we don’t compromise on implant quality.</p>

<h5>Our Focus on Sterilization and Precision</h5>

<p>Another crucial factor in the success of dental implants is the care taken during the procedure. Our clinic follows strict sterilization protocols to reduce any risk of infection, which is one of the leading causes of implant failure. During major surgeries, even our countertops are covered with sterilized paper to maintain a pristine environment. These meticulous measures may seem small, but they go a long way in ensuring the longevity of your dental implants.</p>

<h5>Dental Implants: A Lifetime Investment</h5>

<p>Dental implants, when placed by an experienced specialist like Dr. Roy, are designed to last a lifetime. While other tooth replacement options like dentures or bridges may appear cheaper upfront, they often need repair or replacement every few years, adding to the total cost over time. In contrast, dental implants offer a long-lasting solution, and when properly cared for, can remain functional for decades.</p>

<h5>Why You Shouldn’t Be Fooled by Low-Cost Offers</h5>

<p>Low-cost implant options often cut corners in ways that aren’t immediately visible. Whether it's through using lower-quality materials, shortcuts in sterilization, or a lack of follow-up care, these offers may save you money initially but could lead to costly problems down the road. With Dr. Roy, you’re assured of receiving treatment that prioritizes your health, safety, and long-term success over a cheap price tag.</p>

<h5>Cost effectiveness of Dental Implants compared to Bridges and Dentures</h5>
<p></p>

<p>After 7 years, the costs for a single-tooth implant restoration pay off and the long-term maintenance costs are lower than for a conventional bridge.</p>

<h5>Cost effectiveness of Implants</h5>
<p>Don’t be misled by the initial savings on conventional replacement like Bridge. Besides all the other advantages of Dental Implants over Bridge, there is monetary gain as well.  If you were to compare the total cost between replacing missing teeth with Implants and conventional Bridge, studies have shown that in the long run Implants supported replacement turns out to be economical than the conventional Bridge. It is similar to choosing Electric or Hybrid car over conventional car.
</p>

<h5>Long-term cost efficiency</h5>
<p>In terms of cost-effectiveness, scientific studies came to significant conclusions:</p>
<p>For single-tooth replacement, a single implant is to be regarded as a cost-effective treatment option in comparison to a traditional 3-unit fixed dental prosthesis. <i>See: Priest, GF, Priest JE. The Economics Of Implants For Single Missing Teeth. Dental Economics 2004;94(5):130-138.</i></p>
<p>In some situations with either non- or minimally restored teeth with sufficient bone, an implant reconstruction is recommended from an economical point of view. <i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and cost effectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i></p>
<p>
For the replacement of multiple teeth, dental implant protheses were associated with higher initial costs, but improvements in oral health-related quality of life compared with other treatment options.<i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and cost effectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i>

<h3>Dental Implants</h3>
<p></p>

<p>Dr. Roy has taken several years of advanced training in Dental Implants and have provided long term successful Dental Implants with high esthetic results in number of patients. He use guided surgery which is planned digitally and allows a precise surgical placement of implants. An Implant placed in the centre of the missing tooth allows proper distribution of the chewing load and gives pleasant look. </p>

<p>Replacing teeth with Dental Implants is a better treatment than many other traditional methods. The implants are screw like structure which are placed within the jaw bone. The implants act like the roots of teeth and provide support to the crown (missing teeth). The results with dental implants look, feel and function like natural teeth. </p>

<p>When the tooth is removed the jaw bone collapses and continue to resorb over the time. Dental Implants retards the bone resorption and hence preserve facial profile. </p>

<p>The biggest advantage of dental implant over a conventional bridge is that the implant crown emerges outside the gum and is independently supported without the help of the adjacent teeth.</p>
   
<p>A traditional method of replacing the missing tooth is through Bridge where the artificial tooth is supported by adjacent teeth. Dental Implant is better than Bridge because there is no need to cut the natural teeth as is done for a bridge.</p>

<p>Dental Implants last longer than teeth supported bridge and are esthetically pleasing. </p>

<h4>Advantages of Dental Implants</h4>
<h5>Preserve bone shrinkage</h5>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of placing a dental implant is that it preserves our bone from shrinking to a significant extent. Bone underneath the denture or a conventional bridge has no function and as a result it reduces in size. Over the time, the denture becomes loose or the tissue underneath the bridge collapse and leads to esthetic and functional problems. The rate of this bone loss is reduced dramatically with implants.</p>

<h5>Prevent damage to adjacent natural teeth</h5>
<p>Conventional bridges takes support of adjacent natural teeth and in order to make a bridge the adjacent teeth needs to cut substantially. This may lead to sensitivity. Studies have shown that a significant number of cut teeth undergo necrosis over the time which may necessitate root canal treatment.</p>

<h5>Fixed teeth</h5>
<p>There are many instances where a conventional fix bridge may not be an option especially when molars are missing at the back. Only option in conventional treatment then would be to have removable partial dentures.  Dental implants are ideal in those situations as one can have a fixed teeth.</p>

<h5>Cost Benefit</h5>
<p>Dental Implants can improve your smile and your smile is your best investment.</p>

<h5>Confidence and psychological benefits</h5>
<p>Knowing that we have replaced a missing tooth which is close to natural teeth in many ways boosts our confidence and self dignity.</p>
