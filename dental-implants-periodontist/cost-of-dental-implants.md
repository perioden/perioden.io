</p>
  <h4>The Real Cost of Dental Implants: Why Quality Matters</h4>
  <p>When considering dental implants, the cost is often the first question on a patient’s mind. At Perio Dental, we understand this concern and aim to offer transparency, quality, and value in our treatments. While the price may vary depending on individual circumstances, <b><i>we can assure you that our costs are fair and, more importantly, an investment in long-term oral health and lasting results.</i></b></p>

  <h5>Why Costs Can Vary</h5>
  <p>The cost of dental implants isn't one-size-fits-all because every patient’s needs are unique. Factors like the number of implants, whether extractions or bone grafting are necessary, and the complexity of the case all affect pricing. For example, while a single implant might appear to have a higher cost, multiple implants done during the same visit can reduce the overall price per implant.</p>
  
  <p>At Perio Dental, for dental implants we follow the <strong>BCDA Fee Guide for general dentists</strong>, ensuring that our pricing stays within a fair and competitive range. This guide gives an average range of prices, from high to low, and Dr. Roy’s rates sit comfortably in the middle. While Dr. Roy is a certified specialist in Periodontics, he chooses not to charge the higher dental implant fees recommended for specialists, making his services accessible to a wider range of patients.</p>

  <h5>Why Choose Dr. Mansur Roy?</h5>
  <p>When you come to Perio Dental for dental implants, you are not only paying for the physical implant but also the expertise and care that go into ensuring a successful, long-lasting result.</p>
  
  <h5>Why We Use Straumann Implants: Quality That Lasts</h5>

<p>At Perio Dental, we exclusively use <b>Straumann implants</b>, one of the most well-researched and trusted implant brands worldwide. Straumann implants have a 98.8% long-term survival rate, making them a durable and reliable choice for patients seeking quality. Think of it this way: using cheaper implant brands is like opting for a low-quality store-brand paper towel when you really need a high-end brand like Bounty. The cheaper option may work initially, but it won’t last as long or be as effective in the long run. At Perio Dental, we believe in giving our patients the best, which is why we don’t compromise on implant quality.</p>

<h5>Our Focus on Sterilization and Precision</h5>

<p>Another crucial factor in the success of dental implants is the care taken during the procedure. Our clinic follows strict sterilization protocols to reduce any risk of infection, which is one of the leading causes of implant failure. During major surgeries, even our countertops are covered with sterilized paper to maintain a pristine environment. These meticulous measures may seem small, but they go a long way in ensuring the longevity of your dental implants.</p>

<h5>Dental Implants: A Lifetime Investment</h5>

<p>Dental implants, when placed by an experienced specialist like Dr. Roy, are designed to last a lifetime. While other tooth replacement options like dentures or bridges may appear cheaper upfront, they often need repair or replacement every few years, adding to the total cost over time. In contrast, dental implants offer a long-lasting solution, and when properly cared for, can remain functional for decades.</p>

  <h5>Why We Don’t Provide Exact Prices Upfront</h5>
  <p>While we understand patients often want an exact cost estimate before visiting the clinic, it is impossible to give an accurate quote without a comprehensive examination. Implant treatment varies greatly based on factors like the number of implants required, whether bone grafting is necessary, and the condition of the jawbone. A consultation is the only way to provide a personalized treatment plan and accurate pricing.</p>



  <h5>What You’re Really Paying For</h5>
  <p>Beyond just the implant itself, you're getting value in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dr. Roy’s expertise</strong>: A certified Periodontist with advanced training, which includes years of postgraduate study in dental implants, gum health, and bone grafting. With a periodontist, you’re investing in precision and long-term success, ensuring your implant lasts for decades, not just a few years.</li>
    <li><strong>High-quality materials</strong>: Straumann Implants, designed for longevity.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety and sterilization</strong>: We go to great lengths to maintain a sterile environment to protect your investment.</li>
    <li><strong>Comprehensive care</strong>: From diagnosis to aftercare, we ensure every step of the process is handled with precision.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It’s also important to note that while some practices may offer lower-cost implants, the long-term value is often reduced by lower-quality materials or insufficient expertise. In some cases, this can lead to additional costs down the line for repairs or replacements.</p>

  <h5>A Long-Term Investment</h5>
  <p>While dental implants may seem costly upfront, they provide long-term value. Dentures and bridges may be less expensive initially, but they require regular maintenance and replacement over time. Dental implants, on the other hand, can last a lifetime with proper care. This means fewer trips to the dentist and fewer costs in the long run. They also provide better jawbone support, preventing bone loss that can lead to changes in your facial structure over time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, dental implants improve the quality of life. They allow you to eat your favorite foods, smile confidently, and avoid the discomfort and inconvenience of traditional dentures.</p>

<h4>Dental implants overview</h4>

<p>Dr. Roy has taken several years of advanced training in Dental Implants and have provided long term successful Dental Implants with high esthetic results in number of patients. He uses <b>guided surgery</b> which is planned digitally and allows a <b>precise surgical placement of implants</b>. An Implant placed in the centre of the missing tooth allows proper distribution of the chewing load and gives pleasant look. </p>

<p>Replacing teeth with Dental Implants is a better treatment than many other traditional methods. The implants are screw like structure which are placed within the jaw bone. The implants act like the roots of teeth and provide support to the crown (missing teeth). The results with dental implants look, feel and function like natural teeth. </p>
     
<p>When the tooth is removed the jaw bone collapses and continue to resorb over the time. Dental Implants retards the bone resorption and hence preserve facial profile. </p>

<p>The biggest advantage of dental implant over a conventional bridge is that the implant crown emerges outside the gum and is independently supported without the help of the adjacent teeth.</p>
   
<p>A traditional method of replacing the missing tooth is through Bridge where the artificial tooth is supported by adjacent teeth. Dental Implant is better than Bridge because there is no need to cut the natural teeth as is done for a bridge.</p>

<p>Dental Implants last longer than teeth supported bridge and are esthetically pleasing. </p>

<h4>Advantages of Dental Implants</h4>
<h5>Preserve bone shrinkage</h5>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of placing a dental implant is that it preserves our bone from shrinking to a significant extent. Bone underneath the denture or a conventional bridge has no function and as a result it reduces in size. Over the time, the denture becomes loose or the tissue underneath the bridge collapse and leads to esthetic and functional problems. The rate of this bone loss is reduced dramatically with implants.</p>

<h5>Prevent damage to adjacent natural teeth</h5>
<p>Conventional bridges takes support of adjacent natural teeth and in order to make a bridge the adjacent teeth needs to cut substantially. This may lead to sensitivity. Studies have shown that a significant number of cut teeth undergo necrosis over the time which may necessitate root canal treatment.</p>

<h5>Fixed teeth</h5>
<p>There are many instances where a conventional fix bridge may not be an option especially when molars are missing at the back. Only option in conventional treatment then would be to have removable partial dentures.  Dental implants are ideal in those situations as one can have a fixed teeth.</p>

<h5>Cost Benefit</h5>
<p>Dental Implants can improve your smile and your smile is your best investment.</p>

<h5>Psychological benefits</h5>
<p>Knowing that we have replaced a missing tooth which is close to natural teeth in many ways boosts our confidence and self dignity.</p>


<h4>Factors affecting the final Esthetic Outcome of the Dental Implants</h4>
<p></p>

<p>The biggest challenge in implant dentistry is providing gum tissue in a similar way as our natural teeth. This is because the manner in which our tissue adheres to dental implants is different than as on natural teeth.
</p>

<p>The final esthetic outcome of the dental implants, is determined by many factors, such as:

<ul class="bullets">
<li> <i>timings of placement of implants</i></li>
<li> <i>need for grafting of bone and soft tissue before and during the implant therapy</i></li>
<li> <i>size of implant</i></li>
<li> <i>position of implant</i></li>
<li> <i>cultivation and remodeling of tissue while placing the crown</i></li></ul></p>

<p>A thin receding gum over the implant may show grayish tinge of the inner metal, the crown can appear longer and some times tissue between implants (papilla) are missing which leads to unsightly gaps.
</p>

<p>Periodontists have undergone extensive training with regards to the treatment of dental implants and they are competent in managing the soft tissue around dental implants.
</p>

</p>

<h4>Removable Implant Supported Denture</h4>
<p></p>

<p>The biggest challenge with the conventional denture is that it is supported on gum tissue. Therefore, its chewing efficiency is only 20 to 30 percent as compared to natural teeth. As the time goes by our gums and the bone shrinks and the denture become loose and at times can be a cause of embarrassment in public. As the conventional denture is retained by our muscles, cheeks and gums they need a broad base and that is why these dentures covers the roof of the mouth with a plate, for extra support and retention.
</p>
<p>The removable implant supported denture overcomes all the above drawbacks. They gain very good retention and support from the implants underneath. Furthermore, the implants do not allow the gum and the bone to shrink rapidly. The upper denture need not extend on the roof of the mouth with a broad plate and therefore one feels more natural while eating and talking. They also need less number of implants as compared to fix implant supported teeth and therefore costs less.
</p>
<p>The removable implant supported dentures gives good esthetics as they support lips, cheeks and shows right amount of gum and teeth. Some of the patients may have lost so much of bone over the time that the implant supported fix bridge will not be able to replace the lost bone and gum and may look unnatural. The removable implant supported dentures, however, can overcome these draw backs. 
</p>
<p>The removable implant supported dentures are basically anchored to Implants in two ways-
</p>
<p>1. With the clip on type of attachments called locators.
</p>
<p>2. Bar is seated on the implants and the denture gets anchorage from the bar.
</p>
<p>Both the types of the dentures gives high level of satisfaction for chewing and aesthetics to the patient.
</p>

</p>

<h4>Dental implant site preparation</h4>
<p></p>

<p>For functional and esthetically pleasing Dental Implants, there has to be near to normal bone and soft tissue. Without a good quality and quantity of these tissue the implants may lack proper positioning, good esthetics and longevity.
</p>

<p>In many situation patients have already lost the bone. This is not surprising because the bone shrinks rapidly after the extraction. The papilla between the implant crowns and or between implant crowns and adjacent teeth is a tissue which bears great significance in esthetics. Without proper papilla, black triangular spaces are visible which are highly unaesthetic and may lead to whistling while talking. Added to this the food debris gets trapped in those area.

<h3>All-on-4 Dental Implants</h3>
<h4>A Transformative Solution for Complete Smile Restoration</h4>

<p>The pursuit of a confident and functional smile is an essential aspect of overall well-being and self-esteem. However, tooth loss can significantly impact a person's quality of life, affecting their ability to eat, speak, and feel confident in social situations. In recent years, significant advancements in dental technology have paved the way for innovative solutions, and one such revolutionary approach is the <strong>"All-on-4" dental implant technique</strong>. </p>

<h3>Understanding All-on-4 Dental Implants</h3>

<p>The All-on-4 dental implant technique is a modern solution designed to replace a full arch of teeth using only four strategically placed dental implants. Unlike traditional dentures, which sit on the gums and often lead to discomfort and reduced chewing efficiency, All-on-4 implants offer a fixed, permanent solution that closely resembles natural teeth.</p>

<p>The procedure involves the precise placement of two straight implants in the anterior region of the jaw and two tilted implants in the posterior region. These tilted implants provide additional support and stability, even in cases where bone density might be compromised. Once the implants are securely anchored into the jawbone, a customized prosthetic arch – typically made of high-quality materials like porcelain – is attached, completing the restoration process.</p>

<h3>Benefits of All-on-4 Dental Implants</h3>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Immediate Results: One of the most significant advantages of the All-on-4 technique is its ability to provide patients with a functional and esthetically pleasing smile on the same day as the implant surgery. This immediate restoration can be life-changing, allowing patients to regain their confidence and quality of life without extended waiting periods.</li>
<li>Minimal Bone Grafting: The strategic placement of the tilted implants reduces the need for extensive bone grafting procedures, making All-on-4 implants a viable option for individuals with reduced bone density. This minimizes the complexity of the procedure and the associated recovery time.</li>
<li>Enhanced Chewing Efficiency: All-on-4 implants provide exceptional stability, allowing patients to enjoy a wide range of foods without concerns about denture movement. This improves chewing efficiency and nutrition intake, contributing to overall health.</li>
<li>Improved Speech: Unlike traditional dentures, which can affect speech patterns, All-on-4 implants enable patients to speak clearly and confidently, without worrying about slippage or discomfort.</li>
<li>Long-Term Solution: With proper care and maintenance, All-on-4 dental implants can last for many years, offering a durable and reliable solution for complete smile restoration.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>The All-on-4 Procedure</h3>
<p>The journey to a transformed smile through All-on-4 dental implants involves several stages:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Consultation and Planning: The process begins with a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's oral health, including digital imaging and scans. This information guides the creation of a personalized treatment plan tailored to the patient's unique needs.</li>
<li>Implant Placement: On the day of the surgery, Dr. Roy places the strategically positioned dental implants into the jawbone. This is typically performed under local anesthesia, or using IV sedation, to ensure the patient's comfort throughout the procedure.</li>
<li>Attachment of Prosthetic Arch: Once the implants have integrated with the bone, a custom-made prosthetic arch is securely affixed to the implants. This arch is carefully designed to match the patient's natural teeth, ensuring a seamless and natural appearance.</li>
<li>Follow-Up Care: Regular follow-up appointments are essential to monitor the healing process and make any necessary adjustments. Patients will receive guidance on proper oral hygiene practices and care to ensure the longevity of their All-on-4 implants.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>


<p>The All-on-4 dental implant technique represents a remarkable advancement in restorative dentistry, offering individuals with missing teeth the opportunity to regain their oral functionality, aesthetic appeal, and confidence. Through a streamlined procedure that minimizes invasiveness and recovery time, patients can enjoy the benefits of a complete smile restoration in a relatively short span. All-on-4 implants not only enhance physical health but also contribute to improved mental and emotional well-being, empowering individuals to lead fulfilling lives with a radiant smile.</p>


<h2>Peri-Implantitis</h2>

<p>In recent decades, dental implant technology has revolutionized the field of restorative dentistry, offering patients a durable and natural-looking solution for missing teeth. However, like any medical intervention, dental implants are not without their complications. One of the emerging challenges in implant dentistry is peri-implantitis, a condition that can significantly impact the long-term success of dental implants.</p>

<h3>Understanding Peri-Implantitis</h3>

<p>Peri-implantitis refers to an inflammatory condition that affects the soft and hard tissues surrounding dental implants. It is akin to periodontitis, which affects natural teeth and leads to gum and bone loss. When peri-implantitis sets in, the gum tissue around the implant becomes inflamed, and the supporting bone starts to deteriorate. If left untreated, peri-implantitis can lead to implant failure, jeopardizing the investment made by the patient and the efforts of the dental professional.</p>

<h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>

<p>Several factors contribute to the development of peri-implantitis, including:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Poor Oral Hygiene: Just like natural teeth, dental implants require proper oral hygiene maintenance. Inadequate brushing, flossing, and regular dental check-ups can lead to bacterial buildup and subsequent inflammation.</li>
<li>Smoking: Tobacco use has been linked to an increased risk of peri-implantitis. Smoking compromises the body's ability to fight infections and delays healing, which can exacerbate the condition.</li>
<li>Diabetes: Uncontrolled diabetes can impair the body's ability to heal and fight infections, making individuals with diabetes more susceptible to peri-implantitis.</li>
<li>Periodontal Disease History: Patients with a history of periodontal disease before receiving dental implants may have a higher risk of developing peri-implantitis.</li>
<li>Genetic Predisposition: Some individuals may be genetically predisposed to certain oral health conditions, including peri-implantitis.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Symptoms and Diagnosis</h3>

<p>Detecting peri-implantitis early is crucial for successful treatment. Common symptoms include:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Redness and swelling of the gums around the implant site.</li>
<li>Bleeding gums when brushing or flossing.</li>
<li>Increased pocket depth around the implant (measured during dental exams).</li>
<li>Mobility or looseness of the implant.</li>
<li>Pus discharge around the implant site.</li>
<li>Bone loss evident in X-rays.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Prevention and Management</h3>

<p>Preventing peri-implantitis begins with proper patient education and maintenance. Dental professionals should emphasize the importance of:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Regular Oral Hygiene: Thorough brushing and flossing around the implant site, along with routine dental check-ups, are essential to prevent bacterial buildup.</li>
<li>Smoking Cessation: Encouraging patients to quit smoking can significantly reduce their risk of developing peri-implantitis.</li>
<li>Monitoring: Regular follow-up appointments allow for early detection of any signs of peri-implantitis, ensuring timely intervention.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Treatment Options</h3>

<p>When peri-implantitis is diagnosed, prompt intervention is crucial to prevent further deterioration. Treatment options may include:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Non-Surgical Methods: Scaling and root planing, along with antimicrobial therapy, can help manage peri-implantitis in its early stages.</li>
<li>Surgical Interventions: In advanced cases, surgical procedures such as flap surgery, bone grafting, and implant surface decontamination may be necessary to address the condition.</li>
<li>Implant Removal and Replacement: In severe cases where the implant is compromised, removal and replacement might be the best option.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Peri-implantitis presents a significant challenge in modern implant dentistry, emphasizing the importance of proper patient education, oral hygiene maintenance, and regular dental follow-ups. With early detection and appropriate intervention, the impact of peri-implantitis can be minimized, allowing patients to enjoy the benefits of their dental implants for years to come. Dental professionals and patients alike must remain vigilant in their efforts to prevent and manage peri-implantitis, ensuring the long-term success of this transformative dental procedure.</p>

<h4>Cost effectiveness of Dental Implants compared to Bridges and Dentures</h4>
<p></p>

<p>After 7 years, the costs for a single-tooth implant restoration pay off and the long-term maintenance costs are lower than for a conventional bridge.</p>

<h5>Cost effectiveness of Implants</h5>
<p>Don’t be misled by the initial savings on conventional replacement like Bridge. Besides all the other advantages of Dental Implants over Bridge, there is monetary gain as well.  If you were to compare the total cost between replacing missing teeth with Implants and conventional Bridge, studies have shown that in the long run Implants supported replacement turns out to be economical than the conventional Bridge. It is similar to choosing Electric or Hybrid car over conventional car.
</p>
<h5>Straumann implant solutions. Quality return on investment</h5>
<p>Your health is your wealth, and Straumann dental implant solutions provide:
<ul class="bullets">
<li> Better quality of life</li>
<li> Comfort and convenience</li>
<li> Improved oral health and physical appearance</li></ul></p>
<p>You cannot put a value on one’s health; however, there is a monetary aspect when it comes to deciding between dental implants and conventional restorations. Interestingly, studies suggest that implants may be less expensive
in the long term.
</p>
<h5>Long-term cost efficiency</h5>
<p>In terms of cost-effectiveness, scientific studies came to significant conclusions:</p>
<p>For single-tooth replacement, a single implant is to be regarded as a cost-effective treatment option in comparison to a traditional 3-unit fixed dental prosthesis. <i>See: Priest, GF, Priest JE. The Economics Of Implants For Single Missing Teeth. Dental Economics 2004;94(5):130-138.</i></p>
<p>In some situations with either non- or minimally restored teeth with sufficient bone, an implant reconstruction is recommended from an economical point of view. <i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and costeffectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i></p>
<p>
For the replacement of multiple teeth, dental implant protheses were associated with higher initial costs, but improvements in oral health-related quality of life compared with other treatment options.<i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and costeffectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i>
