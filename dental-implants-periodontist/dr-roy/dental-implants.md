<h1>Dental Implants</h1>

<p>Dr. Roy has taken several years of advanced training in Dental Implants and have provided long term successful Dental Implants with high esthetic results in number of patients. Dr. Roy uses guided surgery which is planned digitally and allows a precise surgical placement of implants. An Implant placed in the centre of the missing tooth allows proper distribution of the chewing load and gives pleasant look. </p>

<h2>Factors affecting the final Esthetic Outcome of the Dental Implants</h2>
<p></p>

<p>The biggest challenge in implant dentistry is providing gum tissue in a similar way as our natural teeth. This is because the manner in which our tissue adheres to dental implants is different than as on natural teeth.
</p>

<p>The final esthetic outcome of the dental implants, is determined by many factors, such as:

<ul class="bullets">
<li> <i>timings of placement of implants</i></li>
<li> <i>need for grafting of bone and soft tissue before and during the implant therapy</i></li>
<li> <i>size of implant</i></li>
<li> <i>position of implant</i></li>
<li> <i>cultivation and remodeling of tissue while placing the crown</i></li></ul></p>

<p>A thin receding gum over the implant may show grayish tinge of the inner metal, the crown can appear longer and some times tissue between implants (papilla) are missing which leads to unsightly gaps.
</p>

<p>Periodontists have undergone extensive training with regards to the treatment of dental implants and they are competent in managing the soft tissue around dental implants.
</p>

<h2>Dental implant site preparation: For functional & esthetically pleasing Dental Implants</h2>
<p></p>

<p>For functional and esthetically pleasing Dental Implants, there has to be near to normal bone and soft tissue. Without a good quality and quantity of these tissue the implants may lack proper positioning, good esthetics and longevity.
</p>

<p>In many situation patients have already lost the bone. This is not surprising because the bone shrinks rapidly after the extraction. The papilla between the implant crowns and or between implant crowns and adjacent teeth is a tissue which bears great significance in esthetics. Without proper papilla, black triangular spaces are visible which are highly unaesthetic and may lead to whistling while talking. Added to this the food debris gets trapped in those area.
</p>


<h2>Advantages of Dental Implants</h2>
<p>Replacing teeth with Dental Implants is a better treatment than many other traditional methods. The implants are screw like structure which are placed within the jaw bone. The implants act like the roots of teeth and provide support to the crown (missing teeth). The results with dental implants look, feel and function like natural teeth. </p>
     
<p>When the tooth is removed the jaw bone collapses and continue to resorb over the time. Dental Implants retards the bone resorption and hence preserve facial profile. </p>

<p>The biggest advantage of dental implant over a conventional bridge is that the implant crown emerges outside the gum and is independently supported without the help of the adjacent teeth.</p>
   
<p>A traditional method of replacing the missing tooth is through Bridge where the artificial tooth is supported by adjacent teeth. Dental Implant is better than Bridge because there is no need to cut the natural teeth as is done for a bridge.</p>

<p>Dental Implants last longer than teeth supported bridge and are esthetically pleasing. </p>
<h2>Preserve bone shrinkage</h2>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of placing a dental implant is that it preserves our bone from shrinking to a significant extent. Bone underneath the denture or a conventional bridge has no function and as a result it reduces in size. Over the time, the denture becomes loose or the tissue underneath the bridge collapse and leads to esthetic and functional problems. The rate of this bone loss is reduced dramatically with implants.</p>

<h2>Prevent damage to adjacent natural teeth</h2>
<p>Conventional bridges takes support of adjacent natural teeth and in order to make a bridge the adjacent teeth needs to cut substantially. This may lead to sensitivity. Studies have shown that a significant number of cut teeth undergo necrosis over the time which may necessitate root canal treatment.</p>

<h2>Fixed teeth</h2>
<p>There are many instances where a conventional fix bridge may not be an option especially when molars are missing at the back. Only option in conventional treatment then would be to have removable partial dentures.  Dental implants are ideal in those situations as one can have a fixed teeth.</p>

<h2>Cost Benefit</h2>
<p>Dental Implants can improve your smile and your smile is your best investment.</p>

<h2>Psychological benefits</h2>
<p>Knowing that we have replaced a missing tooth which is close to natural teeth in many ways boosts our confidence and self dignity.</p>

<h2>Cost effectiveness of Dental Implants compared to Bridges and Dentures</h2>
<p></p>

<p>After 7 years, the costs for a single-tooth implant restoration pay off and the long-term maintenance costs are lower than for a conventional bridge.</p>

<h2>Cost effectiveness of Implants</h2>
<p>Don’t be misled by the initial savings on conventional replacement like Bridge. Besides all the other advantages of Dental Implants over Bridge, there is monetary gain as well.  If you were to compare the total cost between replacing missing teeth with Implants and conventional Bridge, studies have shown that in the long run Implants supported replacement turns out to be economical than the conventional Bridge. It is similar to choosing Electric or Hybrid car over conventional car.
</p>
<p>You cannot put a value on one’s health; however, there is a monetary aspect when it comes to deciding between dental implants and conventional restorations. Interestingly, studies suggest that implants may be less expensive in the long term.
</p>

<h2>Long-term cost efficiency</h2>
<p>In terms of cost-effectiveness, scientific studies came to significant conclusions:</p>
<p>For single-tooth replacement, a single implant is to be regarded as a cost-effective treatment option in comparison to a traditional 3-unit fixed dental prosthesis.</p>
<p>In some situations with either non- or minimally restored teeth with sufficient bone, an implant reconstruction is recommended from an economical point of view. <i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and cost-effectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i></p>
<p>
For the replacement of multiple teeth, dental implant protheses were associated with higher initial costs, but improvements in oral health-related quality of life compared with other treatment options.<i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and cost-effectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i>
