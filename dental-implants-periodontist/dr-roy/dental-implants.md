<h1>Dental Implants</h1>




<p>Dr. Roy has taken several years of advanced training in Dental Implants and have provided long term successful Dental Implants with high esthetic results in number of patients. Dr. Roy uses guided surgery which is planned digitally and allows a precise surgical placement of implants. An Implant placed in the centre of the missing tooth allows proper distribution of the chewing load and gives pleasant look. </p>





<h2>Factors affecting the final Esthetic Outcome of the Dental Implants</h2>
<p></p>

<p>The biggest challenge in implant dentistry is providing gum tissue in a similar way as our natural teeth. This is because the manner in which our tissue adheres to dental implants is different than as on natural teeth.
</p>

<p>The final esthetic outcome of the dental implants, is determined by many factors, such as:

<ul class="bullets">
<li> <i>timings of placement of implants</i></li>
<li> <i>need for grafting of bone and soft tissue before and during the implant therapy</i></li>
<li> <i>size of implant</i></li>
<li> <i>position of implant</i></li>
<li> <i>cultivation and remodeling of tissue while placing the crown</i></li></ul></p>

<p>A thin receding gum over the implant may show grayish tinge of the inner metal, the crown can appear longer and some times tissue between implants (papilla) are missing which leads to unsightly gaps.
</p>

<p>Periodontists have undergone extensive training with regards to the treatment of dental implants and they are competent in managing the soft tissue around dental implants.
</p>

<h3>Dental implant site preparation</h3>
<p></p>

<p>For functional and esthetically pleasing Dental Implants, there has to be near to normal bone and soft tissue. Without a good quality and quantity of these tissue the implants may lack proper positioning, good esthetics and longevity.
</p>

<p>In many situation patients have already lost the bone. This is not surprising because the bone shrinks rapidly after the extraction. The papilla between the implant crowns and or between implant crowns and adjacent teeth is a tissue which bears great significance in esthetics. Without proper papilla, black triangular spaces are visible which are highly unaesthetic and may lead to whistling while talking. Added to this the food debris gets trapped in those area.

<h3>Advantages of Dental Implants</h3>
<p>Replacing teeth with Dental Implants is a better treatment than many other traditional methods. The implants are screw like structure which are placed within the jaw bone. The implants act like the roots of teeth and provide support to the crown (missing teeth). The results with dental implants look, feel and function like natural teeth. </p>
     
<p>When the tooth is removed the jaw bone collapses and continue to resorb over the time. Dental Implants retards the bone resorption and hence preserve facial profile. </p>

<p>The biggest advantage of dental implant over a conventional bridge is that the implant crown emerges outside the gum and is independently supported without the help of the adjacent teeth.</p>
   
<p>A traditional method of replacing the missing tooth is through Bridge where the artificial tooth is supported by adjacent teeth. Dental Implant is better than Bridge because there is no need to cut the natural teeth as is done for a bridge.</p>

<p>Dental Implants last longer than teeth supported bridge and are esthetically pleasing. </p>
<h3>Preserve bone shrinkage</h3>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of placing a dental implant is that it preserves our bone from shrinking to a significant extent. Bone underneath the denture or a conventional bridge has no function and as a result it reduces in size. Over the time, the denture becomes loose or the tissue underneath the bridge collapse and leads to esthetic and functional problems. The rate of this bone loss is reduced dramatically with implants.</p>

<h3>Prevent damage to adjacent natural teeth</h3>
<p>Conventional bridges takes support of adjacent natural teeth and in order to make a bridge the adjacent teeth needs to cut substantially. This may lead to sensitivity. Studies have shown that a significant number of cut teeth undergo necrosis over the time which may necessitate root canal treatment.</p>

<h3>Fixed teeth</h3>
<p>There are many instances where a conventional fix bridge may not be an option especially when molars are missing at the back. Only option in conventional treatment then would be to have removable partial dentures.  Dental implants are ideal in those situations as one can have a fixed teeth.</p>

<h3>Cost Benefit</h3>
<p>Dental Implants can improve your smile and your smile is your best investment.</p>

<h3>Psychological benefits</h3>
<p>Knowing that we have replaced a missing tooth which is close to natural teeth in many ways boosts our confidence and self dignity.</p>


<h2>Fixed Implant Supported Dentures</h2>

<p>Conventional dentures have a tendency to come loose because of the ineffectiveness of dental adhesives—but with implant supported dentures, that ceases to be a problem.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of stabilising dentures with dental implants are:

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Improved speech and confidence</li>
<li>It’s a minimally invasive procedure</li>
<li>Ends the cost and inconvenience of denture adhesives</li>
<li>Restores proper chewing. This allows for a better diet and improved health</li>
<li>Helps stimulate your jaw and maintain bone structure</li>
</ul></p>


<h4>What to expect</h4>
<p>During your initial consultation an x-ray will be taken and a mould of your teeth created to observe the implant position. If you do not have adequate jaw bone structure you may require a bone graft prior to surgery.</p>

<p>After this we will then advise the best form of treatment (either fixed, removable or implant-stabilised) and the best way to proceed with this treatment.</p>

<h3>Different types of implant supported overdentures</h3>

<p>There are three different treatment options with implant supported dentures:</p>

<h4>Fixed</h4>
<p>If  all of your teeth require replacement, a custom made denture can be fitted to dental implant foundations. Once the implants are inserted and have healed, you will be fitted for an overdenture that attaches to the implants. Due to the fact that the overdenture is supported by dental implants it can help stimulate the jaw and  maintain bone mass.
</p><p>Fixed dentures can be removed by a dentist for  professional cleaning and maintenance.
</p>
<h4>Removable</h4>
<p>A removable implant-supported overdenture is created in a similar fashion to a fixed implant-supported overdenture. However,  once the dental implants are placed in your jaw, a custom-made bar will be attached to the implants to support the new overdenture.
</p><p>Your new overdenture will be able to snap or clip into place, and you will be able to remove it for cleaning yourself.
</p>
<h4>Implant-stabilised</h4>
<p>Implant-stabilised overdentures are custom created in the same manner as fixed and removable dentures. However, a smaller number of implants are used to stabilise the denture. This type of denture is able to be taken out each night to clean it.

<h2>All-on-4 Dental Implants</h2>


<p>The All-on-4 dental implant technique is a modern solution designed to replace a full arch of teeth using only four strategically placed dental implants. Unlike traditional dentures, which sit on the gums and often lead to discomfort and reduced chewing efficiency, All-on-4 implants offer a fixed, permanent solution that closely resembles natural teeth.</p>

<p>The procedure involves the precise placement of two straight implants in the anterior region of the jaw and two tilted implants in the posterior region. These tilted implants provide additional support and stability, even in cases where bone density might be compromised. Once the implants are securely anchored into the jawbone, a customized prosthetic arch – typically made of high-quality materials like porcelain – is attached, completing the restoration process.</p>

<h2>Benefits of All-on-4 Dental Implants</h2>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Immediate Results: One of the most significant advantages of the All-on-4 technique is its ability to provide patients with a functional and esthetically pleasing smile on the same day as the implant surgery. This immediate restoration can be life-changing, allowing patients to regain their confidence and quality of life without extended waiting periods.</li>
<li>Minimal Bone Grafting: The strategic placement of the tilted implants reduces the need for extensive bone grafting procedures, making All-on-4 implants a viable option for individuals with reduced bone density. This minimizes the complexity of the procedure and the associated recovery time.</li>
<li>Enhanced Chewing Efficiency: All-on-4 implants provide exceptional stability, allowing patients to enjoy a wide range of foods without concerns about denture movement. This improves chewing efficiency and nutrition intake, contributing to overall health.</li>
<li>Improved Speech: Unlike traditional dentures, which can affect speech patterns, All-on-4 implants enable patients to speak clearly and confidently, without worrying about slippage or discomfort.</li>
<li>Long-Term Solution: With proper care and maintenance, All-on-4 dental implants can last for many years, offering a durable and reliable solution for complete smile restoration.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>The All-on-4 Procedure</h2>
<p>All-on-4 dental implants involves several stages:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Consultation and Planning: The process begins with a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's oral health, including digital imaging and scans. This information guides the creation of a personalized treatment plan tailored to the patient's unique needs.</li>
<li>Implant Placement: On the day of the surgery, Dr. Roy places the strategically positioned dental implants into the jawbone. This is typically performed under local anesthesia, or using IV sedation, to ensure the patient's comfort throughout the procedure.</li>
<li>Attachment of Prosthetic Arch: Once the implants have integrated with the bone, a custom-made prosthetic arch is securely affixed to the implants. This arch is carefully designed to match the patient's natural teeth, ensuring a seamless and natural appearance.</li>
<li>Follow-Up Care: Regular follow-up appointments are essential to monitor the healing process and make any necessary adjustments. Patients will receive guidance on proper oral hygiene practices and care to ensure the longevity of their All-on-4 implants.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>


<p>The All-on-4 dental implant technique represents a remarkable advancement in restorative dentistry, offering individuals with missing teeth the opportunity to regain their oral functionality, aesthetic appeal, and confidence. Through a streamlined procedure that minimizes invasiveness and recovery time, patients can enjoy the benefits of a complete smile restoration in a relatively short span. All-on-4 implants not only enhance physical health but also contribute to improved mental and emotional well-being, empowering individuals to lead fulfilling lives with a radiant smile.</p>




<h3>Cost effectiveness of Dental Implants compared to Bridges and Dentures</h3>
<p></p>

<p>After 7 years, the costs for a single-tooth implant restoration pay off and the long-term maintenance costs are lower than for a conventional bridge.</p>

<h3>Cost effectiveness of Implants</h3>
<p>Don’t be misled by the initial savings on conventional replacement like Bridge. Besides all the other advantages of Dental Implants over Bridge, there is monetary gain as well.  If you were to compare the total cost between replacing missing teeth with Implants and conventional Bridge, studies have shown that in the long run Implants supported replacement turns out to be economical than the conventional Bridge. It is similar to choosing Electric or Hybrid car over conventional car.
</p>

<h3>Long-term cost efficiency</h3>
<p>In terms of cost-effectiveness, scientific studies came to significant conclusions:</p>
<p>For single-tooth replacement, a single implant is to be regarded as a cost-effective treatment option in comparison to a traditional 3-unit fixed dental prosthesis. <i>See: Priest, GF, Priest JE. The Economics Of Implants For Single Missing Teeth. Dental Economics 2004;94(5):130-138.</i></p>
<p>In some situations with either non- or minimally restored teeth with sufficient bone, an implant reconstruction is recommended from an economical point of view. <i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and costeffectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i></p>
<p>
For the replacement of multiple teeth, dental implant protheses were associated with higher initial costs, but improvements in oral health-related quality of life compared with other treatment options.<i>See: Vogel R1, Smith-Palmer J, Valentine W. Evaluating the health economic implications and costeffectiveness of dental implants: a literature review.</i>
