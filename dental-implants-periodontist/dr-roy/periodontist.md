<h3>Specialized Gum and Bone Treatment</h3>
<p>Dr. Roy specializes in a range of periodontal treatments, including gum grafts for receding gums, bone grafts for dental implants, and comprehensive treatment for gum disease. Whether you are facing early signs of gingivitis or need advanced care for periodontitis, Dr. Roy’s personalized approach will help restore your gum health and protect your teeth from further damage.</p>
<h3>Advanced Dental Implants</h3>
<p>As a periodontist with a focus on implant dentistry, Dr. Roy offers precise dental implant placement, even in complex cases. His expertise in bone grafting and sinus lift procedures ensures that even patients with limited bone structure can receive dental implants. From single-tooth implants to <strong>All-on-4</strong> implant-supported dentures, Dr. Roy’s implant solutions are designed to restore function and aesthetics.</p>

 <h3>Dental Implants</h3>
<p>Missing teeth can affect more than just your smile. At Perio Dental, Dr. Roy provides expert placement of dental implants, offering a permanent, natural-looking solution to tooth loss. With a background in both gum health and bone grafting, Dr. Roy ensures that each implant is supported by healthy gum and bone tissue, maximizing the longevity and success of your implant.</p>

<p>We offer a variety of implant treatments, including All-on-4 dental implants, implant-supported dentures, and complex cases requiring sinus lifts or bone grafts.</p>

<h3>Gum Grafting and Receding Gums Treatment</h3>
<p>Receding gums can lead to root exposure and tooth sensitivity, making everyday activities like eating uncomfortable. Dr. Roy offers <strong>gum grafting</strong> procedures, including connective tissue grafts, to regenerate gum tissue and cover exposed roots. This not only improves aesthetics but also protects your teeth from decay and further damage.</p>
<p>If you have receding gums, your teeth may appear longer than usual, and the exposed roots can be sensitive and more prone to decay. Dr. Roy offers connective tissue grafts and lateral pedicle grafts, which use your own tissue to cover exposed roots, restore your gumline, and prevent further damage.</p>


<h3>All-on-4 Dental Implants</h3>
<p><strong>All-on-4 implants</strong> offer a solution for patients needing full-arch tooth replacements. Instead of traditional dentures, All-on-4 implants provide a permanent, natural-looking smile that feels secure and functions like natural teeth.</p>
<h3>Crown Lengthening</h3>
<p>For patients requiring restorative or cosmetic dental work, we provide crown lengthening procedures to expose more of the tooth structure, facilitating better outcomes.</p>
<h3>Gum Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>Gum disease, also known as periodontitis, affects a large portion of the population but often goes unnoticed. Symptoms like bleeding gums, gum recession, bad breath, and loose teeth are signs of advanced periodontal disease, which can lead to tooth loss. Dr. Roy offers treatments to stop the progression of gum disease and, in many cases, regenerate lost gum and bone tissue. This includes procedures such as scaling and root planing, pocket reduction, and advanced gum regeneration techniques.</p>
<h3>Cosmetic Gum Surgery</h3>
<p>For those dealing with a gummy smile (when excess gum tissue makes teeth appear smaller), Dr. Roy performs gum contouring to reshape the gum line, enhancing the appearance of your smile. These cosmetic procedures can be life-changing, giving patients newfound confidence in their smiles.</p>
<h3>The Cost of Periodontal and Implant Procedures</h3>
<p>The cost of procedures like <strong>dental implants</strong>, <strong>gum grafts</strong>, and <strong>All-on-4</strong> varies depending on the complexity of the case. At Perio Dental, we believe in transparency, providing patients with detailed estimates and options to help them achieve the treatment they need.</p>
<p>Whether you need gum grafts, dental implants, or bone grafting, Dr. Roy provides an individualized treatment plan that outlines all costs clearly. While dental insurance may cover part of the treatment, the only way to know for sure is to send a pre-determination.</p>
