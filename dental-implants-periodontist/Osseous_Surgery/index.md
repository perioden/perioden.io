<h1>Osseous Surgery</h1>

<p>Osseous surgery is a type of surgery that is used to treat periodontal disease. It is a procedure that involves removing the infected tissue and bone that is causing the gum disease. This surgery is done to help prevent further damage to the gums and teeth. It is also done to help restore the health of the gums and teeth. Osseous surgery is a common procedure that is done by periodontists to help treat gum disease.</p>

<p>Gum disease is one of the leading causes of tooth loss in adults. When left untreated, it can progress to a severe stage called periodontitis, which affects not just the gums but also the underlying bone that supports the teeth. One of the most effective treatments for advanced periodontitis is osseous surgery—a procedure designed to restore the health of the gums and underlying bone, ultimately preserving your natural teeth. If you have been diagnosed with advanced gum disease, osseous surgery may be the key to preventing further damage and maintaining a healthy smile.</p>

<h2>What Is Osseous Surgery?</h2>

<p>Osseous surgery, also known as pocket reduction surgery, is a periodontal procedure aimed at eliminating deep pockets that form between the gums and teeth due to bacterial infection. These pockets harbor harmful bacteria, which can lead to further bone loss and eventual tooth loss if left untreated.</p>

<p>During the procedure, the periodontist removes diseased gum tissue, smooths out irregularities in the bone, and repositions the gums to fit snugly around the teeth. This reduces pocket depth, making it easier to maintain oral hygiene and prevent reinfection.</p>

<h2>Who Needs Osseous Surgery?</h2>

<p>Osseous surgery is typically recommended for individuals with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Advanced periodontal disease where non-surgical treatments, such as scaling and root planing, have not been effective.</li>
    <li>Deep periodontal pockets that make it difficult to clean below the gum line.</li>
    <li>Bone loss around the teeth, leading to an unstable foundation for your teeth.</li>
    <li>Recurring gum infections, which can increase the risk of tooth loss and systemic health complications.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have been told that you have deep periodontal pockets or bone loss, delaying treatment can worsen your condition. Consulting with a skilled periodontist like Dr. Mansur Roy at Perio Dental can help determine if osseous surgery is right for you.</p>

<h2>The Osseous Surgery Procedure</h2>

<p>The procedure is performed under local anesthesia to ensure patient comfort. In some cases, sedation options may also be available for those who experience dental anxiety. Here’s what you can expect:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Accessing the Affected Area</strong> – The periodontist makes small incisions in the gums to expose the underlying bone.</li>
    <li><strong>Removing Bacterial Deposits and Diseased Tissue</strong> – Plaque, tartar, and infected tissue are carefully removed to eliminate harmful bacteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Reshaping the Bone</strong> – Irregular areas of the bone are smoothed to create an even surface, reducing spaces where bacteria can accumulate.</li>
    <li><strong>Gum Repositioning and Suturing</strong> – The gum tissue is repositioned and sutured into place to reduce pocket depth and promote healing.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Operative Care</strong> – The area is cleaned, and patients are given aftercare instructions to ensure proper healing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recovery and Aftercare</h2>

<p>After osseous surgery, some mild discomfort, swelling, and sensitivity are normal but can be managed with prescribed or over-the-counter pain medications. Following proper post-operative care is crucial for optimal healing. Patients should:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Maintain excellent oral hygiene to prevent bacterial buildup.</li>
    <li>Follow a soft diet for a few days to avoid irritation.</li>
    <li>Avoid smoking, as it slows healing and increases the risk of complications.</li>
    <li>Attend follow-up visits with their periodontist to monitor progress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits of Osseous Surgery</h2>

<p>Undergoing osseous surgery offers significant benefits, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reduction in gum pocket depth, making it easier to clean teeth and gums.</li>
    <li>Preservation of natural teeth by preventing further bone loss.</li>
    <li>Improved gum health, reducing the risk of reinfection.</li>
    <li>Enhanced oral aesthetics, as gums appear healthier and more uniform.</li>
    <li>Long-term protection against severe periodontal disease.</li>
</ul>
