<h1>Gum Grafts for Receding Gums</h1>


<p>Gum plays important part in the esthetic of teeth and face. It is like a curtain which covers the roots of teeth and gives proper length to the crowns. The receded gums (lost tissue) can make the tooth appear longer and shows spaces between teeth.</p>
<p>Gum recession is treated with gum grafts. There are various techniques and materials used with gum grafts.</p>
<p>Periodontists are trained to perform fine plastic surgeries.  At Perio Dental, we use minimal invasive techniques based on current research, using microscope and fine instruments which results in a very natural looking gums and smile.</p>

<h2>Gum Graft - Connective tissue graft</h2>


<p>Tissue is taken from the roof of the mouth and grafted in deficient area. This procedure is highly predictable and provides natural looking tissue. Unlike in the past when it was a painful healing process, today with micro surgical fine instruments and sutures the wound is covered by the outer skin. This makes virtually painless healing and also leads to enhanced esthetics.
</p>

<h2>Allograft or Xenograft</h2>

<p>An alternative to using tissue from the roof of the mouth (autograft) is to use the donor tissue like acellular dermal matrix derived from humans (Allograft) or animal products (Xenograft) such as mucograft. The results of this is very close to the autograft (connective tissue). These materials are processed with sophisticated techniques in the lab and is safe. The results of allograft is equally effective with the added advantage of avoiding second surgery on the palate.</p>

<h2>Lateral pedicle graft</h2>


<p>Tissue is transplanted from adjacent site. Some times a combination of connective tissue graft or allograft and lateral pedicle graft is recommended for best results.
</p>

<h2>Bio Engineered materials</h2>
<p>The Results of grafting procedures can be further enhanced with the addition of biological engineered materials such as EMD (Emdogain) The roots and the tissue are treated with proteins, derived from developing teeth buds of animals or growth factors which can stimulate the body cells to grow in the deficient area.

<h2>Understanding and Managing Gum Recession</h2>

<p>Gingival recession is a common condition seen in daily dental practice, often causing concerns related to aesthetics, tooth sensitivity, and long-term dental health. The apical shift of the gum margin exposes the tooth root, making it vulnerable to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dentine hypersensitivity – Increased sensitivity to hot, cold, and sweet foods.</li>
  <li>Aesthetic concerns – Longer-looking teeth and uneven gumlines that affect a patient’s smile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preventing Gum Recession with Non-Surgical Approaches</h2>

<p>While surgical gum grafting is the most predictable treatment for significant gum recession, early intervention with non-surgical approaches can help prevent its progression. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Professional Root Planing and Scaling – Deep cleaning to remove bacterial deposits from tooth roots, reducing inflammation and preventing further gum loss.</li>
  <li>Plaque control and improved oral hygiene – Using a soft-bristled toothbrush and proper brushing techniques can help maintain healthy gums.</li>
  <li>Desensitizing agents – Fluoride treatments or specialized toothpaste to reduce tooth sensitivity.</li>
  <li>Removing overhanging dental restorations – Poorly placed fillings or crowns can contribute to gum irritation and recession.</li>
  <li>Behavior modification – Addressing factors like aggressive brushing, tobacco use, or malocclusion (bad bite) that may be worsening the condition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Surgical Treatment Options for Gum Recession</h2>

<p>For moderate to severe gum recession, surgical intervention offers the most effective and long-lasting results. A combination of connective tissue grafting (gum grafting) and coronally positioned flaps has been shown in clinical studies to provide the highest percentage of root coverage. Other surgical approaches include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) – This method uses bioabsorbable or nonbioabsorbable membranes to facilitate gum regrowth.</li>
  <li>Acellular dermal matrices (Allografts) and collagen-based materials (Xenografts) – These alternatives to palate tissue harvesting offer similar outcomes without requiring a secondary surgical site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maintaining Gum Health Post-Treatment</h2>

<p>If a patient opts out of surgery or has contraindications for invasive procedures, preventive strategies remain essential to maintain gum health. Regular check-ups, root planing, and lifestyle modifications play a key role in preventing further gum recession.</p>

<p>At Perio Dental, Dr. Roy, a periodontist, provides personalized treatment plans tailored to each patient’s needs. Whether you require preventive care, non-surgical management, or advanced gum grafting, Dr. Roy can help restore your gum health and smile aesthetics.</p>
