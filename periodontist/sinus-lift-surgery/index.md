<h1>Sinus Lift Surgery</h1>

<p>There has been great advancement in sinus lift techniques. After the tooth removal in upper jaw our maxillary sinus which is a hollow structure sitting inside the bone starts migrating downwards and over the time there is very little bone available to place implants. With the sinus lift techniques the floor of the sinus is raised and hence it is possible to place the dental implants.</p>

<p>Sinus lift is performed in several ways. Conventionally a drill is used to cut a window to expose the sinus. It has been found that a good 40% of cases end up with a complication of sinus membrane tear.  With the advent of Piezo Electric techniques there are less complications. At Perio Dental, Dr. Roy utilizes piezo electric and the most conservative way of lifting sinus membrane.</p>
